# Make a repository citable
The easiest way to make your repository citable is to add a `CITATION.cff` file to the repository, as it is supported by both 
[Zenodo's](https://zenodo.org/) and it's [Github integration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) and [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files) itself.
